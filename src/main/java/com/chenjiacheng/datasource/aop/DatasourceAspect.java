public class DatasourceAspect {

    // This class is currently empty, but can be used to implement AOP aspects
    // related to datasource operations in the future.

    // For example, you could add methods to handle before and after advice
    // for methods in the DatasourceService or DatasourceBusinessMapper interfaces.

    // Example method signature:
    // @Before("execution(* com.chenjiacheng.datasource.service.DatasourceService.*(..))")
    // public void beforeDatasourceServiceMethod(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    //     // Logic to execute before a method in DatasourceService
    // }
}
